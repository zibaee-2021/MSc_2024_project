The names given to the attributes aka "items" in mmCIF can be a little obscure.
Here I just give list the items from the two categories used in this project explaining what they are for:

Note the main use of _pdbx_poly_seq_scheme is for getting the amino acid sequence, and merging it to the atom records.

_pdbx_poly_seq_scheme

    .seq_id             Pointer to _atom_site.label_seq_id, itself a pointer to _entity_poly_seq.num:
                                Sequence number, must be unique and increasing.
    .mon_id             Pointer to _entity_poly_seq.mon_id, itself a pointer to _chem_comp.id:
                                3-letter amino acid code, or 1-letter nucleic acid base code.
    .pdb_seq_num        PDB residue number.
    .asym_id            Pointer to _atom_site.label_asym_id (PDB chain identifier).

_atom_site
    .group_PDB          Placeholder for tags used by PDB to identify coordinate records (e.g 'ATOM' or 'HETATM').
    .id                 A unique identifier for each atom position (here is a number).
    .label_atom_id      PDB atom identifier (here is a name string, 'C', 'CA', etc).
    .label_comp_id      PDB 3-letter-code residue names. SANITY-CHECK: DO ATOM_SITE & PDBX_POLY_SEQ_SCHEME GIVE SAME AA
    .label_asym_id      PDB chain identifier.
    .label_seq_id        PDB residue number. Pointer to _entity_poly_seq.num in ENTITY_POLY_SEQ category.
    .Cartn_x            Cartesian X coordinate component describing the position of this atom site.
    .Cartn_y            Cartesian Y coordinate component describing the position of this atom site.
    .Cartn_z            Cartesian Z coordinate component describing the position of this atom site.
    .occupancy          The fraction of the atom present at this atom position.

(Note the CIF enum includes an `S_` or `A_` prefix, this is just for readability/provenance of each property, so the
strings themselves are always only read as a substring from the third character onwards.)

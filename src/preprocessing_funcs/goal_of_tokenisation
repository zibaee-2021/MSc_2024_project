OVERALL GOAL OF TOKENISATION BASED ON NOTES FROM MEETING:

Tokenise each atom.
Tokenise each residue.
Keep track of which residue each atom is associated with.
Take a pdb/mmCIF and tokenise each atom into for example a dict.
The keys of the dict should be:
                                - residue number
                                - atom name
                                    - choose an "anchor atom" (e.g. C3 in RNA; CAlpha or CBeta in protein)
                                    - dict of all atom types
                                        - set of integers
                                        - (Shaun: "enumeration of all characteristics of atom")
                                - atom xyz coordinates

Tokeniser is NOT including coordinates.
Tokeniser "should not be fooled by gaps".
Align atom sequence to PDB sequence.

Ignore any atoms with occupancy less than 0.5. Interpret this as a "missing" atom.

`IdMapper` class in pdb_to_sp_fasta_mapper.py is taken from  https://www.uniprot.org/help/id_mapping.

Out of the 12 methods in IdMapper(), my function `call_uniprot_api_for_acc_ids_and_sp_fasta()` calls:
`submit_id_mapping()`,
`check_id_mapping_results_ready()`,
`get_id_mapping_results_link()`,
`get_id_mapping_results_search()`,

Those 4 functions call the following 5 `IdMapper` private methods:
`_decode_results()`,
`_print_progress_batches()`,
`_get_batch()`,
`_get_next_link()`,
`_check_response()`,

The file format is json, so `_get_xml_namespace()` and `_merge_xml_results()` are never called.
And `_combine_batches()` never seems to be called.

-------

The output is a json file, written to 'data/FASTA/PDBid_sp_FASTA...json'
It has the PDB ids as keys to values that are nested key-values corresponding to one (verified) Swiss-Prot record.
The nested key-values are:
 "sp_acc_id": primary accession number
 "fasta": FASTA protein sequence
 "length": length of the FASTA protein sequence

 If instead the PDBid maps to a null, it means there are no Swiss-Prot records for this protein. There may be Trembl
 sequences, but as these are not verified, they are not included.
 So, the name of the json file may be considered misleading, because it's only a count of the number of PDB ids
 submitted, not the number of Swiss-Prot FASTA sequences retrieved.
